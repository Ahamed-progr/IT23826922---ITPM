This Playwright automation script tests the SwiftTranslator web application, which converts Singlish text into Sinhala. The code follows the Page Object Model (POM) to improve readability and reusability. It includes positive functional tests, negative/edge case tests, and UI real-time typing tests. Test data is handled in a structured format, and outputs are normalized to ensure accurate comparisons despite minor formatting differences. Custom timeouts are used to handle translation delays and improve test stability.
